# UFOs

## Project Overview
I will be creating a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. The table will have ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language. I will be:
  - Building and deploying JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
  - Converting JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
  - Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML.
  - Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop).

## Resources
- Data Source: app.js, data.js, index.html, style.css
- Software: HTML, VS Code, JavaScript

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, I will be creating additional filters for the webpage. The advanced filtering capability will allow users to filter the data by multiple factors.

The goals for this challenge are:
  1. Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
  2. Update an deploy forEach for loops to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
  3. Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using Javascript and HTML.
